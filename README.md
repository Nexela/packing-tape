Players can mine a chest, cargo wagon, or car and pack the item into the player's inventory, preserving its contents.  Additionally, settings like logistics request and filter slots are preserved, as well as fuel and ammo inventories.  Because these chests are items, they can be nested infinitely and as such this likely isn't balanced.

### Mod support

The mod automatically ignores any entity that doesn't have the `player-placeable` or `player-creation` flags.  Additionally, the mod allows other authors to exclude their entities by setting the `not_inventory_moveable` property in its prototype.
